# Implement Lower bound
## Question -> 
The lower bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.

The lower bound is the smallest index, ind, where arr[ind] >= x. But if any such index is not found, the lower bound algorithm returns n i.e. size of the given array.

---
## Approaches ->
- Naive approach (Using linear search)
- Optimal Approach (Using Binary Search): 
1.  Place the 2 pointers i.e. low and high: Initially, we will place the pointers like this: low will point to the first index, and high will point to the last index.
2.  Calculate the ‘mid’: Now, we will calculate the value of mid using the following formula:
`mid = (low+high) / 2`
3.  Compare arr[mid] with x: With comparing arr[mid] to x, we can observe 2 different cases:
-       Case 1 – If arr[mid] >= x: This condition means that the index mid may be an answer. So, we will update the ‘ans’ variable with mid and search in the left half if there is any smaller index that satisfies the same condition. Here, we are eliminating the right half.
-       Case 2 – If arr[mid] < x: In this case, mid cannot be our answer and we need to find some bigger element. So, we will eliminate the left half and search in the right half for the answer.

## Code ->
```cpp
int lowerBound(vector<int> arr, int n, int x) {
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    int ans = n;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        // maybe an answer
        if (arr[mid] >= x) {
            ans = mid;
            //look for smaller index on the left
            high = mid - 1;
        }
        else {
            low = mid + 1; // look on the right
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
